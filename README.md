# PROJECT AND TEAM PRESENTATION
With the project we have developed, we aim to facilitate the rehabilitation of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis patients through an exergame. This is because playing is fun, the fatigue of physical therapy exercises is less noticeable, and the burden of the disease is lightened.<br>
<br>
The video game consists of finding your way out of a maze. By answering questions, you can unlock shortcuts that help you reach the end more easily. Players can choose between two characters, a boy and a girl, to play with. They can also choose between three levels with different degrees of difficulty. Along the way, they may encounter monsters that ask a question, which can be answered by choosing from four possible answers. If the answer is correct, a shortcut opens up. To move the characters, we used Muse2, equipped with a gyroscope. We then used head movement to make the character move forward, backward, right, and left.
